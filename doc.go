/*
Package resolv is a simple collision detection and resolution library mainly geared towards simpler
2D arcade-style games. Its goal is to be lightweight, fast, simple, and easy-to-use for game
development. Its goal is to also not become a physics engine or physics library itself, but to
always leave the actual physics implementation and "game feel" to the developer, while making
it very easy to do so.

Usage of resolv essentially centers around two main concepts: Spaces and Shapes.

A Shape can be used to test for collisions against another Shape. That's really all they have
to do, but that capability is powerful when paired with the resolv.Resolve() function. You can
then check to see if a Shape would have a collision if it attempted to move in a specified
direction. If so, the Resolve() function would return a Collision object, which tells you some
information about the Collision, like how far the checking Shape would have to move to come
into contact with the other, and which Shape it comes into contact with.

A Space is just a slice that holds Shapes for detection. It doesn't represent any real physical
space, and so there aren't any units of measurement to remember when using Spaces. Similar to
Shapes, Spaces are simple, but also very powerful. Spaces allow you to easily check for collision
with, and resolve collision against multiple Shapes within that Space. A Space being just a
collection of Shapes means that you can manipulate and filter them as necessary.
