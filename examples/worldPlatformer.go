				// one onto the other), the collision testing code should probably go with the ramp with the highest confirmed intersection point out of the two.

				// Next, we see if there's been an intersection between the two Shapes using Shape.Intersection. We pass the ramp's shape, and also the movement

				// underneath the Player. This would keep the player from getting "stuck" when walking up a ramp into the top of a solid block, if there weren't
				// a landing at the top and bottom of the ramp.

				// We use 8 here for the Y-delta so that we can easily see if you're running down the ramp (in which case you're probably in the air as you
				// move faster than you can fall in this example). This way we can maintain contact so you can always jump while running down a ramp. We only

			// Because there's a moving floating platform, we use Collision.ContactWithObject() to ensure the player comes into contact
